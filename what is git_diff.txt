Every single commit we do has an commit_id and author name and date
if we want to compare two commits we use git diff
we can compare these two commits by following command
git diff commit_1_id commit_2_id

set of files in git is denoted as repository

Also when we make a change in a code which is common to let say 3 files then after a commit they are updated in all files
